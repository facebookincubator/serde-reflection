The code in this repository is under active development.

## Use cases

This project aims to facilitate the implementation of distributed protocols and storage protocols using Serde. [Serde](https://serde.rs/) is an essential component of the Rust ecosystem that provides (de)serialization of Rust data structures in [many encoding formats](https://serde.rs/#data-formats).

`serde-reflection` makes it easy to to extract a concise representation of the Serde data formats used in a Rust project. This is useful:

* to detect accidental changes to the data formats (e.g. using version control),

* to generate code in other languages (e.g. using our experimental tool `serde-generate`).

In addition to ensuring an optimal developer experience in Rust, the approach based on Serde and `serde-reflection` empowers protocol designers to experiment and choose the best encoding format for their data: either [one of the encoding formats](https://serde.rs/#data-formats) officially supported by Serde, or [a new encoding format](https://serde.rs/data-format.html) developed in the Serde framework.

This project was initially motivated by the need for canonical serialization and cryptographic hashing in the [Libra](https://github.com/libra/libra) project.

In this context, `serde-name` has been used to provide predictable cryptographic seeds for Rust containers.
